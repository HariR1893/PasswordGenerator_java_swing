## Password Generator Console Application

This repository features a password generator project developed as part of my Java Development Internship at InfoAid Tech.

## Overview:
As part of the internship at InfoAid Tech, I took on the challenge of building a password generator console application using Java. This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in Java development, focusing on creating a secure and efficient password generation tool.

## Task Accomplishments:
1. **Java Development:** Leveraged Java to implement a console-based password generator application.

2. **Dynamic Password Generation:** Successfully designed a robust system for dynamically generating secure passwords.

3. **User Interaction:** Implemented a console interface for user input, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.

4. **Customizable Options:** Provided users with options to customize password complexity based on their requirements.

## Project Structure:
The project is structured as follows:

1. `PasswordGenerator.java`: The main Java file containing the logic for password generation.

2. `ConsoleInterface.java`: Java file handling console interactions for user input.

3. `README.md`: This file, offering an overview and description of the password generator project.

## Technologies Used:
- **Java:** Utilized for the core development of the password generator application.

## Usage:
To use the password generator, run the application in a Java-supported environment. Follow the on-screen prompts to customize and generate secure passwords.

## Getting Started:
To get started with the Password Generator console application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HariR1893/aidTech_passwordGenerator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   `cd InfoAidTech-PasswordGenerator`

3. Compile and run the application:
   ```bash
   javac PasswordGenerator.java
   java PasswordGenerator
   ```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to generate secure passwords tailored to your specifications.
